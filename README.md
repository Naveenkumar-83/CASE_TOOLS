Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Bi-cycle management in campus

Introduction: The software requirement specification (SRS) for “Bi-cycle management in campus” defines the working of the project. The SRS begins with a simple introduction followed by the purpose of the project, system requirement, technology used in making the project and then the UML diagrams for the project.
Purpose: the purpose of the project is to solve the bi-cycle problems in campus. The project is going to solve the problems of students-
•	Who have bi-cycle
•	Who don’t have bi-cycle
For those who have bicycle of their own, the registrations for every bi-cycle will be done and a unique registration number will be given to every bi-cycle, which will be printed in back of bi-cycle. The number will help to track the bi-cycle in case of theft. When the student will file a complaint for the theft of bi-cycle there will be an auto generated message sent to the security post in main-gate to track the bi-cycle.
For those who don’t have their own bi-cycle there is a solution. The institute will issue bi-cycles to students at very low rent or at maintenance charge only. Now the question is from where institute will get cycles, so every year many of the final year students leave their cycles in the hostel parking. Institute will take those bi-cycles and use them.
System Requirement:
•	Windows 98 or above OS/linux/unix/MAC OS
•	512 MB or above RAM.

=================================================================

in the modified folder of my project i have changed almost everything from look of the pages to the db. so it would be better you have a look over that.
to start the project working--
first you should have a local server i.e. localhost since it is a PHP project.
second import the db (i've uploaded) into ur localhost.it is in sql format so there will not be any prblm.
Next, start ur browser; type "localhost/casetools/main.php" (if u r having the files in the casetools directory of your localhost's directory.
"care should be taken here"....

if everything goes right..you will be accesing the project.
